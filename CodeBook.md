This repository contains the required scripts to achieve creation of a tidy 
data set from raw data collected from the accelerometers of the Samsung Galaxy S 
smartphone.

The data has been processed as described by the steps in README.md: 
- The original data set contains various accelerometer measurements from 30 
different subjects (i.e. persons) performing six different activities (WALKING, 
WALKING UPSTAIRS, WALKING DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING and LAYING) recorded at 
several occasions. 
- The result generated by the run_analysis.R script only contain the mean and 
standard deviation accelerometer data in all coordinate directions, averaged per 
subject and activity. Thus presenting one value on standard deviation and mean of
each variable per subject and activity, in total 180 observations.
